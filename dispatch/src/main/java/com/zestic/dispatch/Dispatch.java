 * <p>
 * The Dispatch class is used to get or create dispatch objects such
 * as global queues, thread queues, serial queues, or dispatch sources.
 * </p><p>
 * It is encouraged that end users of this api do a static import of the
 * methods defined in this class.
 * <pre>
 * import static com.zestic.dispatch.Dispatch.*;
 * </pre>
 * </p><p>
 * The dispatch queues are {@link java.util.concurrent.Executor}
 * objects that execute tasks asynchronously on thread pools managed by the
 * Dispatcher.
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 *   <b>Global Queues:</b> The tasks submitted to a concurrent dispatch
 *   queue will execute concurrently on the first available thread of
 *   the thread pool.  The order of execution of the tasks is non
 *   deterministic.
 * </li><li>
 *   <b>Thread Queues:</b> The tasks submitted to a thread dispatch
 *   queue will execute serially (FIFO order) on a single thread of
 *   the thread pool.
 * </li><li>
 *   <b>Serial Queues:</b> The tasks submitted to a serial dispatch
 *   queue will execute serially (FIFO order) on the first available
 *   thread of the thread pool.
 * </li>
 * </p><p>
 * All dispatch queues use a shared fixed size thread pool to execute
 * tasks.  All tasks submitted on a dispatch queue should be non-blocking
 * and wait free.
 * </p><p>
 * Dispatch sources provide a way to trigger execution of a user task on
 * on a user selected dispatch queue in response to NIO or application
 * defined events.
