/*
 * The Core Graphics framework is based on the Quartz advanced drawing engine.
 * It provides low-level, lightweight 2D rendering with unmatched output
 * fidelity. You use this framework to handle path-based drawing,
 * transformations, color management, offscreen rendering, patterns, gradients
 * and shadings, image data management, image creation, and image masking, as
 * well as PDF document creation, display, and parsing.
 * <p>
 * In macOS, Core Graphics also includes services for working with display
 * hardware, low-level user input events, and the windowing system.
