/**
 * We are using ReentrantReadWriteLock class of java an implementation of ReadWriteLock that also supports ReentrantLock functionality
 * <p>
 * The ReadWriteLock is a pair of associated locks one for read-only operation and one for writing. Even in a multi-threading application,
 * multiple reads can occur simultaneously for a shared resource. It is only when multiple writes happen simultaneously or intermix of
 * read and write that there is a chance of writing the wrong value or reading the wrong value.
 * <p>
 * Having a pair of read-write lock allows for a greater level of concurrency in accessing shared data than that permitted by a mutual
 * exclusion lock. It exploits the fact that while only a single thread at a time (a writer thread) can modify the shared data, in many
 * cases any number of threads can concurrently read the data (hence reader threads).
 * A read-write lock will improve performance over the use of a mutual exclusion lock if the frequency of reads is more than writes,
 * duration of the read operations is more than the duration of the writes. It also depends on the contention for the data â€“ that is,
 * the number of threads that will try to read or write the data at the same time.
 * <p>
 * Basic idea is whenever a thread is trying to write or update the resource get a read lock. i.e thread who are waiting in a queue
 * to read is waiting for write to happen.
